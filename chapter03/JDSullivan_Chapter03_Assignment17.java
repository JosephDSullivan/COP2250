/**
 * Chapter 03, Assignment 17.
 * Write a program that plays the popular rock-paper-scissor game. (A scissor
 * can cut a paper, a rock can knock a scissor, and a paper can wrap a rock).
 * The program randomly generates a number 0, 1, or 2 representing scissor,
 * rock and paper. The program prompts the user to enter a number 0, 1, or 2
 * and displays a message indicating whether the user or the computer wins,
 * loses or draws.
 * ***Look in the book for a sample run.
